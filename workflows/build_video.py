I've been working on a simple app to show #PresPollSL2024 results in realtime.   

Here's the MVP https://nuuuwan.github.io/prespoll 

I'm not going to explain how to use it, because it should be self-explanatory.  

Comment on what to add/delete/update, and any other feedback.  

Also, (obviously) the data for 2024 is test data, and fake.
